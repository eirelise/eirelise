        <h2>Catnap Cafe</h2>
        <p>391 Colombo Street, Sydenham, Christchurch is the adress of the most dreamy place you can ever think of!! Catnap Cafe offers the standard coffees and desserts. Though the real treasure is not the coffee and desserts, it is the cute and cuddly cats! The cats found in Catnap Cafe are rescues from Cat Rescue Christchurch, so that means you can adopt one of them and take them home with you! Not saying you have to, of course. They do allow walk-ins, but booking secures a guaranteed meet-up for you and the cats for 55 minutes and only for 16$!!!

        <h2>Famhouse Cafe</h2>
        <p>On 400 Papakura-Clevedon Road Clevedon, Auckland you can enjoy the most amazing sweets. With an interesting backstory, Farmhouse Cafe also provides delicious high tea and comes with the sight of seeing beautiful and unique animals. They offer a wide variety of nourishment and drinks! So are you wanting to feel nature in your heart through the experience of living in the moment and at the same time eating desserts that are out of this world? This is the perfect place for you.</p>
        <p>Thereâ€™s also another location in 72 Hillsborough Road Hillsborough, Auckland, though it's not Farmhouse Cafe, it's from the same company. So this is also another choice for more or less the same experience.</p>
